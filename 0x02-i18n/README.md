## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement i18n.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- how to parametrize Flask templates to display different languages
- how to infer the correct locale based on URL parameters, user settings or request headers
- how to localize timestamps

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- All your .py files should be executable
- All your modules should have a documentation
- All your classes should have a documentation
- All your functions and methods should have a documentation
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
